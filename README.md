# Job Retrieval Bot & Database Logger
This bot scrapes job posting data from LinkedIn for positions relevant to UMSI students (or whatever is input). This program outputs position, location, link data, and visualizations. One visualization illustrates where these jobs have the most demand in the country. The other visualization displays the rate of job postings per position. The program uses position keywords and location commands to call scrape data and send messages to Slack with a Slack bot called Job Retriever Bot. The program accumulates job posting data in database files for their respective job types.
